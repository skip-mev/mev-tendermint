The node is a service which currently has the purpose of starting other services up in a particular order and stopping them all when commanded to do so. However, there are many services which are not direct dependents i.e. the mempool and evidence services should only be working when the consensus service is running.

The way these components behave currently is very tightly coupled to one another with references passed back and forth. My guiding principle is that each of these should be able to operate completely independently of each other, e.g. a node should be able to run solely blocksync indefinitely. There have been several ideas suggested towards improving this flow. I\'ve been leaning strongly towards a centralized system, whereby an orchestrator (in this case the node) decides what services to start and stop.\nIn a decentralized message passing system, individual services make their decision based upon a "global" shared state i.e. if my height is less that 10 below the average peer height, I as consensus, should stop (knowing that blocksync has the same condition for starting).
